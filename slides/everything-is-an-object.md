##  Everything is an object

* In Python, **everything** is an object

* This means that pretty much everything has some inherent functions attached


    # String functions
    print "fish, dog, pony".split(",")

    output>> ["fish", "dog", "pony"]

    # Dict functions
    some_dict = {person:"Guido", profession:"Programmer"}

    print some_dict.keys()
    output>> ["person", "profession"]

    print some_dict.values()
    output>> ["Guido", "programmer"]

and many more!
